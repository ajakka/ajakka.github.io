        <p>
          Are you a person like me who keeps hearing the term "React Native
          Architecture" but never quite gets it? Are you a react native
          developer who never touched the /ios and /android folders unless some
          library requires you add some lines there? What are they talking about
          anyways, is it something like MVC or MVVM? Is it some new folder
          structure used to organize your code-base?
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're like me and had these questions, I'd like to report that it
          is none of the above. In fact, you shouldn't worry about it unless you
          have an edge case and need to access native code to solve it, or you
          want to develop a react native library.
        </p>

        <p>
          That being said, let's dive into what is the react native
          architecture.
        </p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2 class="section-title">The Problem (The Bridge)</h2>
          <p>
            React Native has traditionally operated on a bridge-based
            architecture, serving as the communication layer between the
            JavaScript code and native platform. This bridge is asynchronous,
            meaning that every call from JavaScript to native or vice versa must
            pass through this bridge asynchronously.
          </p>
          <p>
            This setup, while effective for a wide range of applications,
            introduced performance bottlenecks, particularly in complex and
            high-performance apps. Operations requiring high-frequency
            interaction between JavaScript and the native side would incur a
            performance penalty due to the overhead of passing messages across
            the bridge.
          </p>
          <p>
            This could lead to less smooth animations, delays in executing touch
            events, and overall less responsive UIs. The need for a more
            efficient way to handle these interactions prompted the exploration
            of a new architecture.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2 class="section-title">The Solution</h2>
          <p>
            The React Native team responded to these challenges with two key
            innovations: Fabric and TurboModules. Both are designed to improve
            React Native's performance and efficiency by reimagining the
            architecture's core.
          </p>

          <div class="subsection">
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Fabric: The New UI Layer</h3>
            <p>
              Fabric is a new UI layer that replaces the traditional bridge with
              a more direct connection between JavaScript and native views. It
              utilizes a concept known as JSI (JavaScript Interface), allowing
              JavaScript code to directly call native functions synchronously.
              This means there's no longer a need for the asynchronous bridge
              for every interaction, which drastically reduces the communication
              overhead, leading to smoother animations and a more responsive
              interface.

              TurboModules: Efficient Native Module Loading
            </h3>
            <p>
              TurboModules also leverage JSI to provide a more efficient way to
              load and interact with native modules. Unlike the old
              architecture, where all modules were initialized at app startup,
              TurboModules adopts a lazy initialization approach. Modules are
              loaded only when they are needed, reducing startup time and memory
              usage. This approach not only speeds up the app's performance but
              also provides a more modular and efficient system for managing
              native code.
